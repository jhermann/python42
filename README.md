> The current answers for Python, the universe, and everything.

This project and its README document my *current* view on the Python eco-system, and specifically how to create, maintain, and release Python projects. And yes, this changes over time which is quite natural, driven by the PEP process and evolving tools.

It reflects *my* preferences and choices, YMMV. Whenever possible, I'll try to provide enough background regarding those choices via some linked resources, which can explai things better than I could here. This page is intended to be and remain a reasonably short document.
